When the marshes were present, there would be times when the sediment in the marshes were in an oxidized envirnment, meaning that there was oxygen in the environment. At other times, when there was a lot of decomposition of organic material, the environment would turn anoxic (lack of oxygen). This can be seen in the sediments in the alternating layers of green and purple layers. The green indicate and anoxic and the purple is oxidized. The color variation is due to the iron in the sediment which in the presence of oxygen will \"rust\" the iron and it shows up as purple in the sediments. \n\nIt was in this layer and this location that the first dinosaurs were discovered by Arthur Lakes, a teacher from Golden, CO.",

The Golden Fault runs along the base of Dinosaur Ridge and has displace the rocks over 2 vertical miles! That means that the rocks on the West side of the fault are 2 verical miles higher than the rocks in the Denver Basin. You would have to drill down in the Denver Basin to find them, see them where they are tilted up on end, or drive up into the mountains to find them. \n\nThere are several types of faults. Normal faults are created when the rocks are pulled apart, Reverse Faults are created when rocks are compressed together and Transform Faults are created when rocks slide past each other. The faults here along the Ridge are reverse faults, caused by compression. ",
